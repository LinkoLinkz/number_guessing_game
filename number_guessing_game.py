# user inputs a range A, B
# machine will pick a random number within range(A, B) and store as the variable 'random_num'
# user makes their first guess within within range(A, B) and is stored as the variable 'guess' (if outside then an error message is displayed)
# user will be displayed feedback based on their input guess whether it is higher or lower than 'random_num'
# number of guesses will be displayed each guess and will be asked to input another guess
# when user guesses the 'random_num' correctly a congratulations message will be displayed as well as the total number of guesses
